A workshop on 'Quality assurance and radiation safety in diagnostic imaging',organised by the Directorate of Radiation Safety in health care settings to enhance protection of patients<br> 
and healthcare workers.<br>
Inaugurating the workshop here on Saturda, Health Secretary Usha Titus said there should be a public health approach to minimising health risks from wide use of radiation in medicine<br>
"Evalution of possible health hazards among healthcare workers is needed. No comprehensive study has been done in Kerala in this area,"she said.<br>
She statedthat the recent discovery of radioactive material in the Mayapuri industrial area of WestDelhi had pointed to the need for radiation protection laws.<br>"Healthcare workers are mostly
unware of radiation safety measures. For instance, an air-conditioner was found in an X-ray chamber in a health centre recently. The authorities did not know this was forbidden.<br>

Considering an 
increasing number of CT scan centresin the state, the Health Department even thought of a moratorium on permits for such units. We know of the alleged nexus between doctors and such centres.<br>A
gulf of centres may cause lesser adherence to rules,"she said.<br>The Health Secretary called upon the agencies involved in radiological procedures to maintain high standards.
